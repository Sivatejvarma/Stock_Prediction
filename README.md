This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It utilizes historical stock market data to train the model and make predictions.

Overview
Stock prediction is a challenging task in the financial domain, as it involves forecasting the future prices of stocks based on past data and various factors affecting the market. This project leverages machine learning to analyze historical stock data, identify patterns, and make predictions about future stock prices.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: Stock Market Dataset. It includes historical stock market data for various companies, including daily stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant information.
